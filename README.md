## Benefits and features:

* Verification, validation, documentation and re-use of mathematical calculations
* Works on smartphone or tablet in portrait and landscape mode
* Supports all commonly used mathematical operations
* Mathematical expressions are written in an intuitive and naturally readable form
* Supports SI and non-SI units (including units of information)
* Powerful mathematical touch-screen editor with undo function makes editing easier
* You can do multiple calculations and subsequently correct or change all used formulas
* It is possible to store intermediate results into 1D, 2D, or 3D array that can improve calculation performance
* Mathematical expressions are collected in a document, that includes not only formulas and plots, but also additional text and images ([SVG format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) is also supported)
* You can store your document on SD card and export it into [LaTeX format](https://www.latex-project.org/) or an image (SD writing permission is needed)
* SD card on Android 6+ is also supported
* The app contains detailed "How to use" page and several examples
* Supports different color themes
* Supports data import from ASCII files
* Integration with [SMath Studio](https://en.smath.info): SMath Studio is able to open workshets stored in microMathematics, see [this document](https://github.com/mkulesh/microMathematics/wiki/Integration-with-SMath-Studio) for details. Documents from SMath Studio can also be opened in microMathematics.
